<h1> Artist Statement: </h1>
<p>
For this work, I wanted to mix both my favorite animal (rat) mixed with the idea such as a maze with different levels that progressively become harder and harder as the players' journey through to help the rat escape the maze. I use photoshop for the background design to make it interesting while also using Figma to design each level with different variations. The main idea for this game is to see how much control players have while using their mouse and refrain from hitting the walls of the maze as it losses the game for the player.
