<p><font color="red">
I was born and raised in Iran, Tehran I migrated to USA at about year 2009 and lived here in California ever sense. My favorite hobbies are shooting at gun range and video games but mostly video games since I can just relax and enjoy the comforts of home.
I started taking interest in media art at about year ago and started making some Photoshop art works, most of my work is generally on Photoshop as I prefer pixels over vectors I try to use other apps that Adobe has to offer but I am pretty novice on those apps at the moment. Finally I am currently taking both Art 74 and Art 75 at the moment at SJSU.
